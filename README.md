- The data used can be found in the folder data of these repository

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is Udacity's Starbucks capstone challenge, an open final project as part Udacityâ€™s data science nanodegree program.
This project build a machine learning model to predict: How much a customer is willing to pay based on the demographics and the type of promotion.

3. 03 - model - This notobook developes and print the results of 4 regression machine learning model (3 for each type of model and 1 for transactions without an offer)
4. E_data pre-processing - this notebook is used to explore the data pre-processing in order to create graphs and tables to use in the article.
5. Starbucks_Capstone_notebook - original notebook provided by Udacity to present the Starbucks capstone challenge. The two images (pic1.png and pic2.png) were also provided by Udacity.
